# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations and examples of data structures in various programming languages, maintained by [@TareqAlKushari](https://github.com/TareqAlKushari).

## Overview

The **Data Structures** repository is intended as a comprehensive resource and study guide for fundamental and advanced data structures. It includes code samples, explanations, and usage examples for a variety of data structures.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- Code samples in different programming languages
- Example usage and demonstration scripts
- Well-documented and easy-to-follow code
- Useful for students, interview preparation, and anyone interested in computer science fundamentals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A compatible compiler or interpreter for the language(s) used (e.g., Python, C++, Java)
- (Optional) Build tools such as `make`, `cmake`, or project-specific tools if provided

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Data-Structures.git
cd Data-Structures
```

### Usage

Each data structure will typically be organized in its own directory or file. Example commands:

#### For Python

```bash
python linked_list.py
```

#### For C++

```bash
g++ linked_list.cpp -o linked_list
./linked_list
```

#### For Java

```bash
javac LinkedList.java
java LinkedList
```

Refer to the README or comments in each subdirectory for more details.

## Folder Structure

Here is a sample structure of the repository:

```
